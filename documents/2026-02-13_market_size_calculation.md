## Part 6: Growth Projections and Market Trends

### Market Growth Drivers

1. **Regulatory Tailwinds:** The European Accessibility Act (EAA) became enforceable on June 28, 2025, requiring digital accessibility for all commercial goods and services in the EU. WCAG 3.0 is in development and will expand compliance requirements. These regulations create mandatory demand for evaluation tools.

2. **Agency Market Growth:** Digital agencies in the 10-50 employee range are growing at 12-15% annually. The total number of US digital agencies grew 10.8% in 2024 alone (IBISWorld).

3. **Web Complexity Increasing:** The average web page now involves more design elements, interactive features, and responsive breakpoints than ever before, increasing the need for automated quality evaluation.

4. **AI Capability Expansion:** Advances in computer vision and large language models enable new capabilities in automated design evaluation that were not previously possible, expanding what design checking tools can do.

5. **Shift-Left Quality Movement:** The industry is moving toward catching quality issues earlier in the development lifecycle (in design, not production), mirroring the DevOps shift-left testing movement.

### Projected Market Growth

| Market Segment | 2025 Value | 2030 Projected | CAGR |
|---------------|-----------|---------------|------|
| Web Design Services | $61.2B | $92.1B | 8.5% |
| Digital Accessibility Software | $850M | $1.89B | 9.3% |
| Web Accessibility Eval. Tools | $474M | $770M | 6.9% |
| Freelance Platforms | $7.65B | $16.5B | 16.7% |
| Website Design Services | $58.2B (US) | N/A | 13.6% |

### 5-Year Revenue Projection (Base Case)

| Year | ARR | YoY Growth | Paying Customers | Avg. ACV |
|------|-----|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| Y1 | $433K | - | 700 | $619 |
| Y2 | $1.7M | 293% | 2,725 | $624 |
| Y3 | $5.2M | 206% | 7,680 | $677 |
| Y4 | $12.0M | 131% | 15,000 | $800 |
| Y5 | $24.0M | 100% | 25,000 | $960 |

Growth rates are modeled to decelerate from hypergrowth in Years 1-2 to sustainable high growth by Year 5, consistent with SaaS benchmarks. The increasing ACV reflects customer upgrades from lower tiers to higher tiers as they scale their usage.

## Part 8: Key Assumptions and Risks

### Key Assumptions

1. **Conversion Rate (Free to Paid):** 3-5% of free users convert to a paid plan. This is consistent with industry benchmarks for PLG SaaS (Hotjar: ~3%, Slack: ~4%, Figma: ~5%).

2. **Churn Rate:** Monthly gross churn of 3-5% in Year 1, declining to 2-3% by Year 3 as product matures. Annual net revenue retention of 100-110% due to plan upgrades.

3. **Pricing Stability:** Prices remain constant through Year 3. In practice, pricing may increase as the product matures and adds enterprise features.

4. **Market Growth:** The underlying market grows at 8-10% annually, consistent with reported CAGRs for web design and digital accessibility markets.

5. **No Major Competitor Entry:** No existing major platform (Google, Figma, Semrush) launches a directly competing holistic design evaluation tool during the projection period.

### Key Risks

1. **Product Risk:** Automated visual design quality evaluation is technically challenging. If the product cannot deliver accurate, useful evaluations, adoption will be limited.

2. **Market Education Risk:** Agencies may not immediately understand the value of automated design evaluation vs. manual review. Market education will require significant content marketing investment.

3. **Competitor Response Risk:** Existing tools (Siteimprove, Stark, Semrush) could add design evaluation features, compressing DesignChecker's differentiation window.

4. **Pricing Risk:** If the market is more price-sensitive than expected, ACV targets may need to be reduced, impacting revenue projections.

5. **Macroeconomic Risk:** Agency growth rates slowed significantly in 2023-2024. A broader economic downturn could reduce agency budgets for new tool adoption.

## Conclusion

The market opportunity for DesignChecker is substantial and growing. The primary target segment of mid-size digital agencies (10-50 employees) alone represents a $144 million global TAM, with a broader SAM of $384 million when including adjacent segments. With conservative execution, DesignChecker can achieve $1.2 million ARR by Year 3; with strong product-market fit and investment, $5-12 million ARR is achievable.

The market is supported by powerful secular trends: growing regulatory requirements for web accessibility, increasing complexity of web design, the shift-left quality movement, and AI capabilities that enable new forms of automated evaluation. The absence of any existing tool that provides holistic, automated web design quality evaluation represents a clear first-mover opportunity.

The recommended go-to-market approach targets US-based mid-size digital agencies first, expands to freelancers and smaller agencies through PLG, and moves upmarket to enterprise customers as the product matures. This mirrors the successful growth strategies of Hotjar, Slack, and Figma.
